# Research Question

What is the environmental impact of transporting oil out of the Uintah Basin? 

# Relevence

Why is this important?

### Transportation emissions are bad for the environment

### Utah has bad air quality

# Literature Review

What has already been done? 

### Other places besides Uintah Basin

### Utah and Uintah Basin

Something like my question hasn't been studied for the Uintah Basin

# Methodology

What methods and data will I use to address the quesiton?

# Conclusion

Because of the lack of research on this specific topic, the project should be done. 


Tak a look at this random graph I made :) 
```{r}
x = c(1,2,3,4,5)
y = c(9,4,1,4,9)

plot(x,y)

```


# Example Code

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
